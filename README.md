# wikimedia_data_learning
Code developed in teaching myself about Wikimedia projects.

First effort is [an IPython notebook analyzing queries](https://github.com/rdhyee/wikimedia_data_learning/blob/master/Exploring%20Quarry%2C%20a%20Service%20to%20Run%20SQL%20Queries%20against%20Wikipedia.ipynb) run at <http://quarry.wmflabs.org/> (a service to "Run SQL queries against Wikipedia & other databases from your browser!")
